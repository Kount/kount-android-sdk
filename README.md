Android Client SDK Setup
========================

Kount's SDK for Android helps integrate Kount's fraud fighting solution into your Android app.

## Requirements

-   [Kount integration](http://www.kount.com/fraud-detection-software)
-   [Android Studio and Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
-   Target Android SDK &gt;= 19(Android 4.4) however, 29(Android10) is recommended for all features to be enabled.
-   Instant App support dependency. You must include the Instant App library at compile time; even if you are not building an Instant App (see Instant App Dependencies below for more information)

NOTE: Due to the restrictions imposed on Instant Apps by Android, Instant App collection may be degraded compared to a full Android App. The current Android Mobile SDK does not support anything below (or earlier than) v4.4.2.

## Installation

Follow the instructions on the developer.kount.com site: https://developer.kount.com/hc/en-us/sections/5319287642260-Integration-Guide?article=4411149718676
